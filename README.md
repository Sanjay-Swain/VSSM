# VSSM
*Very Simple Sales Manager* 
*(Better Name can be proposed)*

#### *This program for now its in a pre-working state, its really not ready to use in a regular manner*

VSSM aims to help with keeping a control of the sales
by providing a client driven classification of data, 
some basic inventory control and summary of data.

For its initial development only cli will be used, without 
any fancy interface, after this a "front end" will be developed 
to use on cellphones and computers alike, adding support for connecting to "backend"
either to an internet server or to a local server, as well as adding more features.

*Initial development will be over when all initial 
features are implemented*
